# Feature: Get User Cart

#    Scenario Outline: Get cart by user
#       Given I have the client ID "<client_id>" and authorization "<authorization>"
#       When I request the cart for the user
#       Then the response status should be <expected_status>
#       And the response should contain the cart details
#       And the response should match the structure of the JSON

#       Examples:
#          | client_id    | authorization | expected_status |
#          | <EXCEL_DATA> |               |                 |
